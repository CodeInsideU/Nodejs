// Synchronous programming means it will usea single thread, so only
// one operation or program will run at a time

// sync is blocking, it will only send the server one request at a time
// and will wait for that request to be answered by the server

// Asynchronous is non blocking, which means it will send multiple 
// request to a server at a time

// Async increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time.
